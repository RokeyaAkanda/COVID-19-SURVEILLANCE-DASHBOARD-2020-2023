# COVID-19-SURVEILLANCE-DASHBOARD-2020-2023
While creating this data dashboard, we learned how to collect the data from various sources, analyze the collected data, find trends in the data, and then visualize the data with real-time graphs to them. In addition to that, dashboard design is a more creative skill that we learned while designing our dashboard. This is an important phase because we have shown effective visualizations in our dashboard in a way that suits the requirements of the audience watching it. It is an experience for us to improve our data management and analysis skills in this way.
