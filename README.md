# COVID-19-SURVEILLANCE-DASHBOARD-2020-2023
While creating this data dashboard, I learned how to collect the data from various sources, analyze the collected data, find trends in the data, and then visualize the data with real-time graphs to them. In addition to that, dashboard design is a more creative skill that i learned while designing our dashboard. This is an important phase because I have shown effective visualizations in this dashboard in a way that suits the requirements of the audience watching it. It is an experience for me to improve my data management and analysis skills in this way.
